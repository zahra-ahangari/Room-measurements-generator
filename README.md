# Room-measurements-generator
A small program that will take the user's room measurements and calculate the results. 

# Upgraded 
I tried to upgrade the original Room-measurements-generator to use the [nullable reference types](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/builtin-types/nullable-reference-types) by enabling this feature in the `.csproj` file as below:

```
<Nullable>enable</Nullable>

```
